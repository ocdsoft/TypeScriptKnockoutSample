# TypeScriptKnockoutSample

[Typscript and Knockout](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/knockout.html)

This sample project was built from the walkthrough in the link above, but modified slightly to work in [VS 2015 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx).

If you would like to use another editor follow the steps in the above documentation and it should work great!

Happy coding!
