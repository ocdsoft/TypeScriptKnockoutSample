# TypeScriptKnockoutSample

[Typscript and Knockout](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/knockout.html)

This sample project was built from the walkthrough in the link above, but modified slightly to work in VS STudiod 2015 Community.

If you would like to use another editor follow the steps in the above documentation and it should work great!

Happy coding!
